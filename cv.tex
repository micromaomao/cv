  \section{Education}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BSc Computer Science} \dashdiv{} University College London \dashdiv{} 2019-2022

      Second-year grade average: 82.3\%

      Notable coursework (able to provide code upon request):

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A journey planner for the\tflicon{} London rail network (tube \& others) entirely in C.

        \begin{itemize}
          \item Shows paths with least station, least interchange or paths that avoid certain fare zones.
        \end{itemize}

        \item A Tetris bot in Python which can reliably keep itself alive long enough to reach a 1000 blocks limit, and scored 3rd place in the 140 person class.

        \item Designed and wrote a system specification for a hypothetical good delivery service for vulnerable people during COVID, matching requests with volunteers with an efficient algorithm. Received a top submission award.

        \item Led a 3-person team on implementing a bash-like shell in Java, with piping, substitution, glob expansion, and 97\% test coverage. Built an \href{https://jsh-sandbox.maowtm.org}{\color{link}online sandbox} for the shell with Docker, Rust and Xterm.js.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{A-Level} \dashdiv{} (Shenzhen, China) Nanshan Chinese International College \dashdiv{} 2017-2019

      Math, Further Math, Physics and Economics \dashdiv{} A*A*A*A*

  \section{Work Experience}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Technology Intern \dashdiv{} \textbf{Marshall Wace LLP} \dashdiv{} Jul-Aug 2021

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Designed and built a release dashboard for developers to search for and check the build and deploy status of their projects.
      \item Used React (front-end), Python/fastapi (backend) and \href{https://oss.redis.com/redisgraph/}{\color{link}Redisgraph} (a graph database based on Redis which supports \href{https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/}{\color{link}Cypher}). Used APIs to read information from different services including Kubernetes. Used \href{https://prometheus.io/}{\color{link}Prometheus} to export metrics which helped debug performance issues.
      \item Worked in a team with 2 other interns. Delivered a project presentation and demo to the whole of the Technology division, and incorporated developer feedback. Wrote documentation for extending the system to add other service integrations.
    \end{itemize}
