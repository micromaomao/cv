    \item Web development: React/\href{https://svelte.dev/}{\color{link}Svelte}, Nodejs, Webpack. Plain CSS \& SCSS.

    \item Linux (scripting, programming, server administration and some understanding of the inner-workings), Git, Docker. Some basic experience with OpenGL and Android native development.

    \item Security (web \& native) \& Basic cryptography. \href{https://blog.maowtm.org/ct/en.html}{\color{link}Interactive blog article on certificate transparency}

  \end{itemize}

  \section{Personal Projects}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \href{https://status.maowtm.org}{\color{link}\textbf{status.maowtm.org}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/serverwatch}: simple server monitoring with web push notification \dashdiv{} Aug-Sept 2019.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Backend built with Rust, using the \href{https://rocket.rs}{\color{link}Rocket} framework and SQLite database.
      \item Frontend built with \href{https://svelte.dev/}{\color{link}Svelte}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \href{https://paper.sc}{\color{link}\textbf{paper.sc}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/schsrch}: Past paper finder \& search engine for a high school exam board \dashdiv{} 2016-2019

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Average of \raisebox{0.2\baselineskip}{\texttildelow}9000 daily searches over 365 days (2019-2020); recommended by a number of teachers.
      \item Backend built with Node.js, using MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
      \item Frontend built with React, using Webpack for bundling. Acts as a PWA with ServiceWorker.
      \item Made a PDF viewer: using PDF.js for rendering, wrote own input handling (touch screen \& Macbook trackpad pinch-to-zoom, inertia scrolling, etc.).
      \item Parses the document to find matching question numbers and hence create hyperlinks in the PDF viewer between question paper and mark scheme for the same question.
      \item Includes extensive unit tests, and builds on Travis CI.
    \end{itemize}
