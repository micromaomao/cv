  \section{Personal Projects}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{ctclient} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/ctclient}: Certificate Transparency Log client \dashdiv{} Jul-Aug 2020

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Written in Rust, following \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962}{\color{link}RFC-6962}.
      \item Supports monitoring of CT logs and checking certificates (e.g.\ to see if a new certificate has been issued for a certain domain). Is able to check proofs and detect log misbehaviour.
      \item Companion project 1: \href{https://blog.maowtm.org/ct/en.html}{\color{link}Interactive blog article on certificate transparency}
      \item Companion project 2 (work in progress): a public-facing, open source certificate monitoring service.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \href{https://leafvote.mww.moe}{\color{link}\textbf{leafvote}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/leafvote}: Real-time live voting \dashdiv{} Aug 2018

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Technically a personal project, but was built for my high school to use in student union elections.
      \item Each voter gets a personal QR code printed on paper, and on the day of election everyone gathers in front of an assembly screen and starts voting.
      \item Front-end built with React, backend Node.js with MongoDB. Communicates with websocket for lower latency. Ballets generated with \LaTeX.
      \item Successfully handled 300+ voters at once.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \href{https://paper.sc}{\color{link}\textbf{paper.sc}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/schsrch}: An A-level/GCSE past paper finder \& search engine \dashdiv{} 2016-2019

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Average of \raisebox{0.2\baselineskip}{\texttildelow}9000 daily searches over 365 days (2019-2020); recommended by a number of teachers.
      \item Backend built with Node.js, using MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
      \item Frontend built with React, using Webpack for bundling. Acts as a PWA with ServiceWorker.
      \item Made a PDF viewer: using PDF.js for rendering, wrote own input handling (touch screen \& Macbook trackpad pinch-to-zoom, inertia scrolling, etc.).
      \item Parses the document to find matching question numbers and hence create hyperlinks in the PDF viewer between question paper and mark scheme for the same question.
      \item Includes extensive unit tests, and builds on Travis CI.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}

  \section{Other Interests}

  \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1\parskip]
    \item Able to do some basic 3D modelling with Blender \href{https://maowtm.org/Artworks/}{\color{link}(some works I've done)}.

    \item Higher mathematics unrelated to programming.
  \end{itemize}
