  \section{Education}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BSc Computer Science} \dashdiv{} University College London \dashdiv{} 2019-2022

      Second-year grade average: 82.3\%

      \begin{itemize}
        \item Built a Tetris bot in Python which can reliably keep itself alive long enough to reach a 1000 blocks limit, and scored 3rd place in the 140 person class.

        \item Designed and wrote a system specification for a hypothetical good delivery service for vulnerable people during COVID, matching requests with volunteers with an efficient algorithm. Received a top submission award.

        \item Led a 3-person team on implementing a bash-like shell in Java, with piping, substitution, glob expansion, and 97\% test coverage. Built an \href{https://jsh-sandbox.maowtm.org}{\color{link}online sandbox} for the shell with Docker, Rust and Xterm.js (not part of the coursework).

        \item Worked with Unity and the Alexa voice API as part of an industry project.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{A-Level} \dashdiv{} (Shenzhen, China) Nanshan Chinese International College \dashdiv{} 2017-2019
