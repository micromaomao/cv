  \section{Education}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BSc Computer Science} \dashdiv{} University College London \dashdiv{} 2019-2022

      Have consistently achieved high grades. Notable coursework (able to provide code upon request):

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A journey planner for the\tflicon{} London rail network (tube \& others) entirely in C.

        \begin{itemize}
          \item Shows paths with least station, least interchange or paths that avoid certain fare zones.
        \end{itemize}

        \item A Tetris bot in Python which can reliably keep itself alive long enough to reach a 1000 blocks limit, and scored 3rd place in the 140 persons class.

        \item Designed and wrote a system specification for a hypothetical good delivery service for vulnerable people during COVID, matching requests with volunteers with an efficient algorithm. Received a top submission award.

        \item Led a 3-person team on implementing a bash-like shell in Java, with piping, substitution, glob expansion and 97\% test coverage. Built an \href{https://jsh-sandbox.maowtm.org}{\color{link}online sandbox} for the shell with Docker, Rust and Xterm.js.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{A-Level} \dashdiv{} (Shenzhen, China) Nanshan Chinese International College \dashdiv{} 2017-2019

      Math, Further Math, Physics and Economics \dashdiv{} A*A*A*A*
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Educational game development for GCSE Physics/Chemistry/Biology.
      \item Debugged a large (200 kLOC) React project to make sure everything works on all major browsers.
      \item Implemented new requirements in the existing PHP (Symfony) based system.
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Learned PHP and Symfony concepts on the go.
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Won first place in an algorithm contest of 180 people.
      \item Rewarded with Â£1,000 Tesco (sponsor) gift card.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Facebook \dashdiv{} Hack-a-project \dashdiv{} 29\textsuperscript{th} Feb 2020
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Team of 4 people won second-place (against 8 other teams)
      \item Designed a baisc React \& Nodejs App \ghurl{https://github.com/HAP-Team4/front-end} for bringing people who want to watch the same movie together.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Skills}

  \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1\parskip]
    \item Languages: (primary) Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++; (fluent) Go, Python, Java, Mathematica (Wolfram Language)

    \item Web development: React, Svelte, Plain CSS \& SCSS.

    \item Backend: NodeJS, Rust (Rocket, Diesel), SQLite, PostgreSQL.

    \item Linux (scripting, programming, server administration), Git, Docker; OpenGL; some Android development.

    \item Security (web \& native) \& Basic cryptography.
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Personal Projects}

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \textbf{ctclient} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/ctclient}: Certificate Transparency Log client \dashdiv{} Jul-Aug 2020

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Written in Rust, following \href{https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6962}{\color{link}RFC-6962}.
      \item Supports monitoring of CT logs and checking certificates. Is able to check proofs and detect log misbehaviour. Also made an \href{https://blog.maowtm.org/ct/en.html}{\color{link}interactive blog article on certificate transparency}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \href{https://leafvote.mww.moe}{\color{link}\textbf{leafvote}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/leafvote}: Real-time live voting \dashdiv{} Aug 2018

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Technically a personal project, but was built for my high school to use in student union elections.
      \item Like mentimeter, except each voter gets a personal QR code printed on paper to prevent double-voting.
      \item Front-end: React, backend: Node.js + MongoDB + pdflatex. WebSocket for lower latency.
      \item Successfully handled 300+ voters at once.
    \end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
