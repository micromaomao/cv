  \section{Education}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BSc Computer Science} \dashdiv{} University College London \dashdiv{} 2019-2022

      Have consistently achieved high grades. Notable coursework (able to provide code upon request):

      \begin{itemize}
        \item A journey planner for the\tflicon{} London rail network (tube \& others) entirely in C.

        \begin{itemize}
          \item Shows paths with least station, least interchange or paths that avoid certain fare zones.
        \end{itemize}

        \item A Tetris bot in Python which can reliably keep itself alive long enough to reach a 1000 blocks limit, and scored 3rd place in the 140 persons class.

        \item Designed and wrote a system specification for a hypothetical good delivery service for vulnerable people during COVID, matching requests with volunteers with an efficient algorithm.
      \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{A-Level} \dashdiv{} (Shenzhen, China) Nanshan Chinese International College \dashdiv{} 2017-2019

      Math, Further Math, Physics and Economics \dashdiv{} A*A*A*A*
  \end{itemize}

  \section{Skills}

  \begin{itemize}[itemsep=0.1\parskip]
    \item Languages: Rust, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java/Kotlin, C++; \TeX.

    \item Linux (scripting, programming, server administration and some understanding of the inner-workings), Git, Docker; Web \& Android development.

    \item Security (web \& native) \& Basic cryptography. \href{https://blog.maowtm.org/ct/en.html}{\color{link}Blog article on certificate transparency}

  \end{itemize}

  \section{Personal Projects}

  \def\ghurl#1{%
    \href{#1}{({\blueghicon{}})}%
  }

  \begin{itemize}

    \item \href{https://status.maowtm.org}{\color{link}\textbf{status.maowtm.org}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/serverwatch}: simple server monitoring with web push notification \dashdiv{} Aug-Sept 2019.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Backend built with Rust, using the \href{https://rocket.rs}{\color{link}Rocket} framework and SQLite database.
      \item Frontend built with \href{https://svelte.dev/}{\color{link}Svelte}.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \href{https://paper.sc}{\color{link}\textbf{paper.sc}} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/schsrch}: CIE past paper quick finder \& search engine \dashdiv{} 2016-2019

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Average of \raisebox{0.2\baselineskip}{\texttildelow}9000 daily searches over 365 days (2019-2020); recommended by a number of teachers.
      \item Backend built with Node.js, using MongoDB and Elasticsearch.
      \item Frontend built with React, using Webpack for bundling. Acts as a PWA with ServiceWorker.
      \item Made a PDF viewer: using PDF.js for rendering, wrote own input handling (touch screen \& Macbook trackpad pinch-to-zoom, inertia scrolling, etc.).
      \item Parses the document to find matching question numbers and hence create hyperlinks in the PDF viewer between question paper and mark scheme for the same question.
      \item Includes extensive unit tests, and builds on Travis CI.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{ts-player} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/ts-player}: a terminal recorder that produces files capable of efficient random access \dashdiv{} Jan 2019

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Written in Go, used on Linux.
      \item Uses \href{https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers}{\color{link}protobuf} for storage format and \href{https://facebook.github.io/zstd/}{\color{link}zstd} for compression.
      \item Uses the Linux termios API to execute process in monitored PTY, and a Golang binding of \href{http://www.leonerd.org.uk/code/libvterm/}{\color{link}libvterm} to parse terminal escape sequences (to get the color and position of characters right).
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{go-ecbpass} \ghurl{https://github.com/micromaomao/go-ecbpass}: a deterministic, stateless pseudo-random password generator \dashdiv{} Oct 2018

    \begin{itemize}
